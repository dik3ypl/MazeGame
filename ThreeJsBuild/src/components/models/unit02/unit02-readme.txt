Model description       : Super-Deformed version of the Evangelion Unit02 from Neon Genesis Evangelion
			  
Other info              : The model, like all Evas, is to be considered female in gender(Sexy, too!).

Thanks to              	: This would not have been possible without the original vision 
			  provided by Gainax.

			  Thanks to the Quake Community, Id software.
			  Those jerks @ Sunstorm Interactive, Especially Npherno and his wonderful coding 
		   	  and MrRogers for his youthful enthusiasm and input.
                          A big thanks to all those involved with the Q2pmp.  Without all of the
			  response the site has gotten, I doubt the model would have seen the light of day.

* Play Information *

New Sounds              : <YES> The current sounds are to be considered temporary. r13 had paid another model author to do sounds for the model. However, at the release date he's still not seen them. So for a quick fix, he whipped up some pitch shifted sounds based on the standard id sounds. They do the trick of extending the mood of the character, but little else. New sounds one way or another should be coming in the future.

CTF Skins               : <NO>  We just couldn't get to that as well. If any skin authors are interested in doing some, we'd be more than happy to look at some quick sketches on the skin. We'd rather you don't do the entire set and present us with them.  If we don't like them, we may not endorse them and they might become wasted efforts. Obviously the red one is done, but we're senstive to how the other colors are portrayed.  If we are presented with a set that do the trick, we'll repackage the model with them.

VWEP Support            : <NO>  It could be concievably done, but not today.

Editors used            : Initial model created by Thump in Autocad R14 one face at a time!
				Further tweaked in Qme, Quake 2 Model Editor, and 3D Studio 							
				Max (Whew!)

			  The skin was painted one pixel at a time with various versions 
				of Npherno's Skin Tool (thanx so much N, It's still the
 				only way to fly!) with minor use of Corel Photo Paint.

			  Animated By R13 In 3D Studio Max 2.5 and Character Studio 2.1

Known Bugs              : Shoulder face with Eva logo will rotate into the large shoulder armor piece during some animations. This is due to the model being r13's first attempt at skinning a biped in Character Studio. It doesn't ruin the model or is even really noticable in game.  But it's pretty obvious when viewing it in a model viewer on in screenshots.  Although if you watch the anime, this isn't really wrong as the arm and shoulder guard can move independently.  However, it's not what I was intending.   

Build/Animation time    : One Entire Mother Fucking Year.


* Author's Notes *

r13- This is the first character model I've ever animated (well.... that's not quite true- there was another unit02, that I scrapped, much to Thump's displeasure).  I learned Character Studio with that model and after doing the second model [unit00] I realized I needed to do some tweaking on this one.  The tweaking turned into every single animation being redone.  So although some of this model is new, about 40% still retains some of the older motions and it definately has the 1st set of vert assignments to the biped.  

Thump- This is my first quake2 model and I don't make them in autocad, anymore. I still feel that the head needs to be bigger in the true spirit of Super-D, but r13 had a hard enough time keeping it from smacking into the shoulder guards as large as it is. Further, we discovered that It can be a real pain to animate a super-d model. Sigh. I do feel a bit guilty about wasting 24% of the skin space, but the 76% used provided was more than enough pixels, and the copyright needed to be added. I hope you enjoy it-
it's been a long time coming ('bout time the the damn thing was done!)
